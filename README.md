My team, TechBuddies, participated in a hackathon conducted by CodeSoc, where we developed an innovative calendar project that provides holiday information for different countries. This project allows users to easily check public holidays based on their selected country, making it a valuable tool for travelers, businesses, and individuals planning their schedules. Through this experience, we enhanced our coding skills, collaborated effectively, and tackled real-world problems with technology.
